## Agile Prgm: Telematics Control Unit (TCU) 
A telematic control unit (TCU) in the automobile industry is the embedded system on board a vehicle that wirelessly connects the vehicle to cloud services or other vehicles via V2X standards over a cellular network. The TCU collects telemetry data from the vehicle, such as position, speed, engine data, connectivity quality, etc., from various sub-systems over data and control busses. It may also provide in-vehicle connectivity via Wifi and Bluetooth and implements the eCall function when applicable. <br>

In the automotive domain, a TCU can also be a transmission control unit. <br>

A TCU consists of: <br>

- A satellite navigation (GNSS) unit, which keeps track of the latitude and longitude values of the vehicle
- An external interface for mobile communication (GSM, GPRS, Wi-Fi, WiMax, LTE or 5G), which provides the tracked values to a centralized geographical - information system (GIS) database server
- An electronic processing unit
- A microcontroller, microprocessor, or field programmable gate array (FPGA) which processes the information and acts as an interface to the GPS
- A mobile communication unit
- Memory for saving GPS values in mobile-free zones or to intelligently store information about the vehicle's sensor data
- A battery module <br>

## Qualcomm Telematics SDK 
A Product of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. 
Below info Quote from https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/qualcomm-telematics-sdk <br>

The connected car is a broad frontier of wireless possibilities, and the Qualcomm® Telematics SDK is your path for developing telematics applications.

Connected-car developers can use the Telematics SDK for rapid development and deployment of applications that run on telematics control units (TCU). The SDK abstracts the modem and hardware in the modem and includes full documentation, sample applications, header files and stub code. <br>

What Can You Build into Your Applications with the Telematics SDK? <br>
With the Telematics SDK you can build out features for a wide range of connected-car scenarios including identity management, ridesharing, operator flexibility, fleet management, data analytics and firmware-over-the-air (FOTA) updates.

The SDK provides a set of backward-compatible APIs to access low-level modem services and functionality. The APIs cover basic and advanced telematics, including:

- Telephony services — Dialing out, answering calls, conferences, call management and status
- SMS services — Sending and receive SMS messages, including multi-part messages
- SIM card services — Enumerating applications, reading EFs from card and sending messages to SIM card
- eCall support — Initiating eCalls
- Connection management — Bringing up and tearing down cellular backhaul
- Location services — Supporting location fixes



Our Vancouver R&D team is responsible for the development of the TCU software. <br>

## Weekend Hiking @Saint Marks Summit
>St. Mark's Summit is part of the Howe Sound Crest Trail that spans over 30km from Cypress to a point along the Sea to Sky Highway near Porteau Cove. The section of the trail that St. Mark's Summit is on starts from Cypress Mountain which is the first mountain along this route and offers spectacular views of Howe Sound on a clear day.


St Marks is the most beautiful trails I’ve ever seen!  🚶🚶‍♀️ 🚶🚶‍♀️ 🚶🚶‍♀️ Highly suggested taking photos from the viewpoint, definitely breathtakingly beautiful!  The last 2 km is hard, lots of tree roots to climb, but the view is totally worth it. 2L water is needed if you decide to complete all the trail!

## ICT Project: KPN Europe

> As the incumbent in the Netherlands, KPN employs more than 30,000 people across both its domestic and international business lines and in 2010 generated revenue of €13.4bn from a total customer base in excess of 42m customers. Outside of its domestic market, KPN serves customers in France, Germany (E-Plus), Belgium (BASE) and Spain. Serving more than 20m customers alone in Germany, E-Plus and its sub brands are recognized as market leaders, and their success has been seen by many as an example of MVNO excellence from both a multicultural proposition and market execution perspective.


 THE KPN BSS project was the first project I've worked on in Europe. As an software engineer, I was responsible for application deployment, issue handling and testing.  This project was fast-paced, super complex, high visibility, and most importantly, a strategy project for Huawei Europe.   <br>

  All of KPN’s non-domestic operations are managed by KPN International (KPNI), a wholly owned unit within KPN dedicated to the management of more than 100 MVNOs across Europe. It manages both wholesale and retail relationships with the balance tipping slightly in favor of the former. While KPNI acts independently in its pursuit of its overarching goal to focus on attaining market excellence through its MVNO brands across Europe, the unit benefits from its parent company in multiple ways: <br> 

  - KPNI has the backing of a solid balance sheet
  - KPNI has the backing of a solid balance sheet KPN was the first mobile operator to market with an end-to-end IT outsourcing, which provides cost-effective solutions across the KPNI portfolio
  - KPN has honed a “smart follower” tactic over the years, which provides clear alignment with the MVNO business in terms of delivering solutions that maximize the price
performance ratio — a critical factor given that approximately 60% of KPN’s total customer base consists of prepaid subscribers<br>

In 2009, senior management at KPNI decided that change was needed and decided to implement an improved IT operation and maintenance platform to achieve greater efficiencies and future growth. It specifically wanted to address:<br>
   
  - The misalignment between the centralized IT organization and the fact that each local IT network was in fact maintained separately 
  - Slow reaction speeds in terms of launching new brands and new tariff introductions, especially roaming charges 
  - Further reduction of its IT overheads

Future growth also implied a flexibility of solution that would:<br>
 
  - Be built upon a single platform that could serve KPNI’s existing and future aspirations 
  - Not require significant customization for implementation across the KPNI network of countries 
  - An easy to manage end-to-end solution with a single vendor, allowing for smooth integration, testing and after-deployment updates

## Project Magnum
To summarize, a solution with a robust core but with the ability for minimal customization depending upon the market would allow KPNI to achieve its aforementioned goals.<br>
 
 Magnum is a cloud-based integrated OSS/BSS system consisting of a software platform and customer service functionalities (including implementation and technical service). Additional infrastructure (servers) are provided by Getronics, an ICT services company owned by KPN. While MVNOs outsource all operations to reduce cost, Magnum focuses on the reduction of cost through the enhanced utilization of resources across KPNI’s multibrand and multicountry portfolio.<br>
  
The provisioning of a service across geographic and brand borders required close communication between KPNI, the individual country teams and the Huawei teams to ensure that the centralized service would indeed provide the promised functionality. Furthermore, a total of six migration environments were created to provide training, the ability to test across KPNI and Huawei as well as an emulation environment, which provided the final live test conditions prior to full migration.<br>
  
  Having set a goal to become the pan-European platform of choice in Europe, KPNI started the migration to the new system in Spain and then introduced Magnum to France, Belgium and Germany at a rate of one brand migration every six weeks. <br>

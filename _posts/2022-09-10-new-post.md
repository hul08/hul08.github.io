## Weekend Hiking @Sea to Sky
>Starting from the base of the Sea to Sky Gondola, the Sea to Summit Trail rises through the lower sections of the Stawamus Chief and Shannon Falls Provincial Park Trails and continues up what was once an inaccessible route through beautiful forest to the top of the Sea to Sky Gondola. Views of Howe Sound, Sky Pilot and the surrounding peaks abound throughout. A three to five hour intermediate hike climbing just over 900 metres, the Sea to Summit Trail is definitely a must do.


**SEA TO SUMMIT TRAIL** is definitely one of my favourite trails in Vancouver!🌄🌄 The St. Mark's Summit trail is well trafficked and well marked. Nice walk through the woods to get you up to the switchbacks. The last 1km is the most difficult one with lot of roots and climbing which is so exciting! 🧗‍♂️🧗‍♂️<br>

**Overall speaking,** this was a fantastic hike and also a challenging/advanced trail.<br>
This trail is a good workout, and offers a lite bit of everything, some small scrambles, few ropes, lots of up hill climbing for the first 4km. <br>
Can be somewhat challenging and difficult for some people(not me😉).<br>
The trail keeps climbing through the forest with plenty of viewpoints along the way.<br>  
keep exploring the easy view-point-filled trails up the summit!<br> 
Don't forget bring at least 2L water! very important! 🥤🥤<br>

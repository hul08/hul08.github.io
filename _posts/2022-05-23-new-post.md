## A day trip to Victoria

>Victoria, capital of British Columbia, sits on the craggy southern end of Vancouver Island. With abundant parkland, it’s known for outdoor activities. The city's British colonial past shows in its Victorian architecture, including stately Craigdarroch Castle mansion. Butchart Gardens, with 55 acres of vivid floral displays, plus statuary, water features and a carousel, is one of many formal gardens in the city. ― Google

## British Columbia Parliament Buildings
**Where:** 501 Belleville Street

**What:** This collection of grand Parliament Buildings located on the Inner Harbour are a sight to see, with their stained glass, domes and turrets. Home to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, this is where the province’s elected representatives meet to shape its future through debates and passing laws.

**Highlights:** The Parliament Buildings are open to the public for free tours. Take the 45-minute guided tour to discover the history of the province and learn about the architectural delights of the beloved heritage building as well as the parliamentary process. You’ll get to peek behind the façade on this entertaining tour, and you can even enjoying dining at the “secret” politicians’ restaurant, the Parliamentary Dining Room, open Monday through Friday for breakfast and lunch. Be sure to view the buildings after dark too, when they’re lit up like a Christmas tree.

## Hatley Castle: The Best of the Two Castles in Victoria

>Hatley Castle History
Completed in 1908, Hatley Castle was the brainchild of coal baron James Dunsmuir, formerly the Premier of British Columbia and, at the time the castle was built, Lieutenant Governor of the province. Considered the richest man in British Columbia, Dunsmuir apparently told local architect, Samuel Maclure, that “money doesn’t matter, just build what I want”. Happy to oblige, Maclure used all local stone to design the elegant exterior, then spared no expense inside, featuring teak floors, oak and rosewood panelled rooms, a baronial fireplace and custom light fixtures.

It's a National Historic Site and also home to Royal Roads University.

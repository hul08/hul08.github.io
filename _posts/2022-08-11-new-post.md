# How to Set Up an IKEv2 VPN Server

## Introduction

IKEv2, or Internet Key Exchange v2, is a protocol that allows for direct IPSec tunneling between the server and client. In IKEv2 VPN implementations, IPSec provides encryption for the network traffic. IKEv2 is natively supported on some platforms (OS X 10.11+, iOS 9.1+, and Windows 10) with no additional applications necessary, and it handles client hiccups quite smoothly.

I recently set up an IKEv2 VPN server on Azure, here is how.

## Prerequisites

<p>You will need a VM on any of the cloud service providers, like GCP, Azure, AWS etc. In my case I'm using Azure, a Standard B1ls (1 vcpu, 0.5 GiB memory) VM in the US region. for OS, I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS gen2.  <p>

<p> The OS recommended as the following:

 - Ubuntu 22.04, 20.04 or 18.04
 - Debian 11 or 10
 - CentOS 7 or CentOS Stream 9/8
 - Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 9/8
 - Oracle Linux 9, 8 or 7
 - Amazon Linux 2

## Installation server application

<p> Firstly, you should update your OS. It is optional, but highly recommended to do so.

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
There are several options for you to install the service. 
  
 <p>## 1> Install directly <p>
  
  ```
  wget https://get.vpnsetup.net -O vpn.sh && sudo sh vpn.sh
  ```
  by doing this, you could avoid to input any credentials but instead get the random credentials. 
  
  Otherwise you have to input your credentials yourself, something like this:
  ```
  wget https://get.vpnsetup.net -O vpn.sh
nano -w vpn.sh
[Replace with your own values: YOUR_IPSEC_PSK, YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_PASSWORD]
sudo sh vpn.sh
  ```
   
   
   ## 2> Docker
<p>In my case, I'm using docker to simplify the process. <p>
  Firstly, download the docker image from the docker Hub registry. 
  
  
    docker pull hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server
  
 
   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79688638/199863409-ae210765-5fdf-4095-b131-d31617e31f81.png">
  
   ## Start the server
<p>Create a new Docker container from this image. replace ./vpn.env with your own env file, otherwise you can remove env then you will use a random one. <p>
  
  
  ```
  docker run \
    --name ipsec-vpn-server \
    --env-file ./vpn.env \
    --restart=always \
    -v ikev2-vpn-data:/etc/ipsec.d \
    -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro \
    -p 500:500/udp \
    -p 4500:4500/udp \
    -d --privileged \
    hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server
  ```
  ## Find your login information
  <p>If you did not specify an env file in the docker run command above, 
  the random credials will be randomly generated. 
  To retrieve them, view the container logs:<p>
  
  ```docker logs ipsec-vpn-server```
 
    
<p>  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79688638/199864363-53cd2a6e-277c-45e7-8971-4213684f5fd9.png"><p>

## Get the p12 file from server
In order to use IKEv2 client, we need some additional configrations.when we installing the IKEv2 server, 
there's an IKEv2 client (with default name vpnclient) is created, located: /etc/ipsec.d inside the container. 
we need to copy config file(s) to the Docker host then use it in our client application:
<p>Check contents of /etc/ipsec.d in the container:<p>
    
    
    docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ls -l /etc/ipsec.d
    
<p>Copy a client config file from the container to the current directory on the Docker host.  We need this vpnclient.p12 file, so copy it to our local PC by FTP.<p>
 
 ``` docker cp ipsec-vpn-server:/etc/ipsec.d/vpnclient.p12 ./```
  
  Now we are done on the server side.
  
  ## IKEv2 VPN client settings
  ## WINDOWS settings
   1. p12 file should be in your device
   2. download this script into the filefolder together with the p12: 
  [ikev2_config_import.cmd](https://github.com/hwdsl2/vpn-extras/releases/latest/download/ikev2_config_import.cmd) 
   3. Run the script **Run as administrator** and follow the prompts.
  
  To connect to the VPN: 
  Click on the wireless/network icon in your system tray(right down corner), select the new VPN entry, 
  and click **Connect**. 
  Once connected, you can verify that your traffic is being routed properly by your IPSEC server. 
  
  VoilÃ , enjoy~ ðŸ¤ŸðŸ¤ŸðŸ¤Ÿ

## Project Story: Telenor Convergent Billing System(CBS)
>The billing system swap for Telenor Pakistan (TP) has been the first step in Telenor Group's strategic transformation in Asia. The Group’s leaders have attached great importance to this swap, dubbed "Trango" (a Pakistani peak notoriously hard to conquer). TP planned to build a brand new IT architecture-based billing engine to realize transformation from traditional billing to a market-oriented revenue-generating operating model. The new billing engine would greatly optimize customer experience and shorten service TTM.


I joined the Telenor CBS team in 2012, and was responsible for leading the Data Migration from Amdocs Compact Convergence Charging to Huawei OCBS ( OCS, UVC, EVC). <br>

## Information Transformation  
  With the help of our engineering team, the new system supports all user categories (pre- and post-paid) and delivers online real-time billing for all services (voice, SMS, MMS, and data services), while preventing large-scale bad debts from the source. The system’s agility ensures that most requirements do not need customized development, shortening service TTM from half a year to one to three days. With the successful transformation of its billing system, the foundation is laid for TP’s other transformations.<br>

According to Irfan Wahab Khan, TP’s CMO,
>"I am very excited and proud to witness the success of such a big and important swapping project. More surprising is that the upgrade leads to successful business transformation of Telenor through perfect integration of technical and business processes. I must say the painstaking work of the Trango project team, consisting of Telenor and Huawei members, proved a great success. "

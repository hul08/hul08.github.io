## Overview
It is an overview of a PM's daily workflow at Fortinet, from receiving the ticket request to closure. <br>
- Usually, there are two types of requests: feature development and bug fix, and they use the same process. <br>
- "Top3" refers to a specific branch/process focused on resolving urgent issues or developing new features for some major clients. <br>
- After the helpdesk receives the request from the customer, the ticket will be sent to the top3 queue for processing after it has been reviewed. <br>
- As soon as the PM starts working on a ticket from the backlog, R&D resources will be assigned, and we will begin working on the issue or feature. <br>

# How we working on CI/CD as a Project Manager

>Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), also known as CI/CD, embodies a culture, operating principles, and a set of practices that application development teams use to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. <br>
>CI/CD is a best practice for devops teams. It is also a best practice in agile methodology. By automating integration and delivery, CI/CD lets software development teams focus on meeting business requirements while ensuring code quality and software security.

## Overview
It is an overview of a PM's daily workflow at Fortinet, from receiving the ticket request to closure. <br>
- Usually, there are two types of requests: feature development and bug fix, and they use the same process. <br>
- "Top3" refers to a specific branch/process focused on resolving urgent issues or developing new features for some major clients. <br>
- After the helpdesk receives the request from the customer, the ticket will be sent to the top3 queue for processing after it has been reviewed. <br>
- As soon as the PM starts working on a ticket from the backlog, R&D resources will be assigned, and we will begin working on the issue or feature. <br>

## Request a branch

Based on the request from the customer, PM will create a new branch from the main in Jenkins and notify the team to work on this branch. <br>
- Typically a General Availability (GA) version is required for the customer's production environment. <br>

## Software development
Sometimes, we have to simulate the same issue in our test environment to find the root cause. <br>
- We will collect all the necessary information from the customer, including the configuration files, logs, and even remote sessions if needed. <br>
- During the technical lead phase, PM will work closely with the customer and engineering teams to ensure that the issue or requirement can be addressed clearly, the right people will be involved, remove the roadblocks, monitor the status and risks, and finally, the deliverable will resolve the issue.<br>
- Whenever the customer's issue can be reproduced in our lab, which is ideal for our investigation. In some cases, it's impossible to replicate the exact problem, which makes it more complex, and it will take more effect and time to resolve those issues.  <br>
- Upon finding the root cause, PM will lead the team in developing a solution and finally deliver a new build for the customer.  <br>
- In most of the top3 cases, because of the system's complexity, there might be more than one dev team involved, which means different developers are fixing part of the problems. The project manager has to coordinate them and ensure everyone is on the same page. 
- This phase could be time-consuming and require the project manager to control the direction and risks properly. 
- The project manager has to decide on trade-offs and workarounds.

- As shown below, one ticket can have multiple issues that need to be resolved. <br>
- PM needs to find the right team and resources to work on each specific issue. <br>
- And PM also needs to consider the dependency of issues, which sometimes can be tricky if problems are connected. <br>

## Solution Sent and ticket closure 
Once the solution has been delivered, we will let the customer test it and provide feedback if there are any issues.  <br>
Typically, a ticket needs to be closed in 2 weeks, and each PM needs to handle 6-8 cases weekly. So it means it requires good multi-tasking and time management skill. <br>

After the solution is sent, we still need to discuss the issue or feature with the product manager to see if it needs to merge into the main; if so, a code merge request will be raised and finally merged into the next GA release version. <br>

# Daily workflow as Project Manager at Fortinet

>Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), also known as CI/CD, embodies a culture, operating principles, and a set of practices that application development teams use to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. <br>
>CI/CD is a best practice for devops teams. It is also a best practice in agile methodology. By automating integration and delivery, CI/CD lets software development teams focus on meeting business requirements while ensuring code quality and software security.

## Overview
This overview details a Project Managerâ€™s daily workflow at Fortinet, from receiving a ticket request to closure. <br>
Types of Requests:

       - Feature Development
       - Bug Fix

<br>
Both types of requests follow the same process. "Top3" refers to a specific branch/process focused on resolving urgent issues or developing new features for major clients. <br>

1. Ticket Review:

      - The helpdesk receives a request from the customer.
      - The ticket is reviewed and sent to the Top3 queue for processing.
2. Ticket Processing:

      - The Project Manager (PM) starts working on a ticket from the backlog.
      - Research and Development (R&D) resources are assigned to address the issue or feature.

## Request a branch

Based on the request from the customer, PM will create a new branch from the main in Jenkins and notify the team to work on this branch. <br>
- Typically a General Availability (GA) version is required for the customer's production environment. <br>

1. Issue Simulation:

   - Sometimes, the issue must be simulated in the test environment to find the root cause.
   - Necessary information is collected from the customer, including configuration files, logs, and possibly remote sessions.
2. Collaboration:

   - The PM works closely with the customer and engineering teams to ensure clarity, involvement of the right people, removal of roadblocks, status monitoring, and risk management.
   - Reproducing the issue in the lab is ideal but not always possible, complicating the resolution.
3. Solution Development:

   - The PM leads the team in developing a solution and delivering a new build to the customer.
   - Multiple development teams may be involved, requiring the PM to coordinate efforts and ensure alignment.
4. Time Management:

   - This phase can be time-consuming, demanding the PM to control direction and manage risks.
   - The PM must decide on trade-offs and workarounds.
5. Issue Resolution:

   - One ticket can have multiple issues that need resolution.
   - The PM must find the right team and resources for each specific issue and consider dependencies, which can be tricky if issues are connected.

## Agile Project Management
We use Phabricator as our project management tool during development and testing phases. <br>

<br>
### Planning
Usually, I will set up a kick-off meeting with the stakeholders, finalize the scope of the work, identify the risks, break down the epics into tasks and assign them to team members. <br>

Therefore, the very first step of the work is a good initiation and plan sprints together with teams. <br>
- There is a clear owner for both the product (deliverable) and the process (sprint/iteration).<br>
- Time boxes define the amount of work to be completed within a specific period of time (sprint/iteration).<br>
- Work is broken down into specific tasks that can be accomplished within a single sprint.<br>
- Teams are responsible for the completion and delivery of promised work by the end of the sprint.<br>

### Schedule daily stand-ups

The following work for me is to track the status by scheduling daily stand-ups to ensure that cross-functional members are all on the same page.<br>
Here, three questions will be asked:<br>

- What did I accomplish since the last meeting?<br>
- What am I working on until the next meeting?<br>
- what is getting in my way or keeping me from doing my job?<br>

A daily stand-up meeting gives everyone a chance to clarify what he/she can accomplish, and what needs to be improved or any issue. It also lets everyone briefly list what's the current problems or delays he/she may has, so some team members may know when to jump in to help out. This is an effective way to resolve complex problems together and keep the team synced up. 


## Solution Sent and ticket closure 

Once the solution is delivered, the customer tests it and provides feedback. Typically, a ticket should be closed within two weeks, with each PM handling 6-8 cases weekly, requiring good multitasking and time management skills.

After delivering the solution, discussions with the product manager determine if the code needs to merge into the main branch. If so, a code merge request is raised, and the code is merged into the next GA release version.  <br>
